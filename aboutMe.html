    <!-- paragraph intro -->
    <p>
        I am a recent graduate from California State University Dominguez Hills. While at CSUDH I switched from C++ to
        Java where I learned advanced algorithms and in-depth data structures. School was never my strong suit, but I
        found an appreciation for learning and excelled within my classes.
